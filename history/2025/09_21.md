I want to devlelop an operating system on x86_64 platform. Technically The first step is to gain an overview of OS. (~~but how do I suppose to know what is an **OS** before I really made one?~~

So anyway I decided to begin with **UEFI**. 

> **UEFI** is the brief of **Unified Extensible Firmware Interface**. It 's a new firmware interface to replace the previous **BIOS**, the **Basic I/O System**.

So what is **BIOS** again?  

> **BIOS** is a firmware that stored on your motherboard that initiallize hardware during booting process and provide runtime services for operating system and programs.

Hmm. Good definition but still meaningless to those who don't really know what **BIOS** really is.
